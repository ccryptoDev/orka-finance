        <br />
        At Orka Finance Inc., your privacy is very important to us. This online

        Finance Inc., its successors, assignees and affiliates (collectively
        “Orka,” “we,” “us” or “our”) via Orka’s website portal, through Orka’s
        solar loan program(s), including financial products offered by Orka or
        third-party lending partners and other related financial services
        products, through Orka’s dealer partner program(s), and via prospective

        <br />
        <br />
        This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) applies to data collected by Orka Finance
        Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries and affiliates, “Orka,” “Us,”
        Our” or We”), a provider of business loan products and related services
        (collectively “Services”). The Policy has two parts:<br />
        <br />
        <ul class="whale">
          <li>
            <strong>Part 1</strong> provides our<strong>
              U.S. Privacy Policy</strong
            >, including our Privacy Policy for https://www.orkafinance.com
            (“Website”), which is owned by and operated by Orka. This Policy
            describes how Orka collects and uses the personal information you
            provide (directly or through third parties), or which is
            automatically generated when you interact with our Website.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Part 2 </strong>is our California Supplement, which provides
            our<strong>
              California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) Privacy
              Policy</strong
            >. The CCPA provides various rights to consumers who reside in
            California about their personal information. A natural person,
            including a business owner or guarantor, is considered a consumer
            under the CCPA. Any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning
            when used in Part 2.

        <br />
        <strong>Part 1: Orka U.S. Privacy Policy</strong><br />
        <br />
        This Privacy Policy describes the choices available to you regarding our
        use of your personal information and how you can access and update such
        information. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information”
        means information that personally identifies you, including your contact
        information, IP address, and loan application information. A large
        portion of the Personal Information we collect, use, share, and store is
        sensitive in nature, including your social security number and financial
        account information (“Sensitive Personal Information”).<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Information We Collect</strong><br />
        <br />
        We collect the following information from you:<br />
        <br />
        <ul class="whale">
          <li>
            Contact information such as name, business name, email address,
            mailing address, and phone number;
          </li>
          <li>

            statements, your average bank balance, personal and business income
            and credit history, payment behavior, bank account information and

            Business information including company size, business type, and
            business industry;
          </li>
          <li>

            description, estimated property value, and mortgage information; and
          </li>
          <li>Beneficial ownership information*</li>
        </ul>
        In addition to collecting information via our Website and Mobile App, we
        may also conduct a site visit to collect information, and obtain
        information and external data used by lenders to process applications
        and complete and manage transactions, e.g., from credit reporting
        agencies and other vendors, as well as from social media. Once you are
        an Orka customer, we may reach out to you for, or otherwise obtain,
        information as needed to provide the Service.<br />
        <br />
        * When required in the U.S., we will collect information on the
        beneficial owners of our business customers for purposes of verifying
        their identity only. The U.S. Government implemented the beneficial
        ownership regulation to help deter financial crimes. By complying, we
        are doing part in upholding the regulation to protect the financial
        system. Pursuant to our privacy policies and procedures, we will
        maintain beneficial ownership information in our system of record.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>Tracking Technologies</strong> <br />
        <br />
        Orka and our partners (for example, our marketing partners), affiliates,
        or analytics or service providers, including our live chat, marketing
        trackers, and survey tool service providers use cookies or similar
        technologies. These technologies are used in analyzing trends,
        administering the Website, tracking users’ movements around the Website
        and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We
        may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these
        companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.<br />
        <br />
        A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for
        record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for user authentication and
        analytics. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual

        <strong>Log Files</strong> As is true of most websites, we gather
        certain information automatically and store it in log files. This
        information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type,
        internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system,
        date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this
        automatically collected log information with other information we
        collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you and to
        improve marketing, analytics, and Website functionality.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Behavioral Advertising/Re-Targeting</strong><br />
        <br />
        We partner with third parties to display advertising on our Website and
        manage our advertising on other sites. Our third-party partners may use
        technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities
        on this Website and other sites in order to provide you advertising
        based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not

        <br />
        <strong>Security of Information</strong><br />
        <br />
        Orka takes the security of your information very seriously. Your
        information is securely sent to Orka with 128 bit-encryption over the
        Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. This creates an encrypted
        connection between your browser and our servers. Thus, when you enter
        Sensitive Personal Information (such as a bank account number) on our
        order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information. If you
        have any questions about the security of your personal information, you
        can contact us at
        <a href="mailto:support@orkafinance.com">support@orkafinance.com</a
        >.<br />
        <br />
        If you allow Orka to see your banking information online rather than in
        paper form, it is on a read-only basis. We do not have access to change,
        edit, or modify bank account information in any way. Orka employees
        cannot view your banking username and passwords. <br />

        <strong>Sharing Personal Information</strong><br />
        <br />

        Orka may share your information with its affiliated or subsidiary
        entities for business purposes, such as financial reporting. Should you
        apply to Orka or its affiliated entities for a financial product or
        service, Orka may share your application status, borrowing history, and
        loan performance. Orka will share your Personal Information with third

        as required by law. We do not sell your Personal Information to third
        parties.<br />
        <br />

        We will provide your Personal Information, which may include application
        information, to our trusted business partners, third party lenders of
        Orka products, service providers, and subsidiaries and affiliates to
        provide financing and/or to provide services to help us with our
        business activities, such as offering customer service, processing
        credit checks or secure data storage, and other similar services. These
        companies are authorized to use your Personal Information only as
        necessary to provide these types of services to us. In addition, we may
        share your basic information (name, company name, phone number, email
        address and requested loan amount) with one of our business partners to
        market their services to you, provided, however, if you do not want us
        to share your Personal Information in these circumstances with these
        business partners you can opt out at the email or mailing address
        provided in Orka’s Privacy Policy Part 1, which precedes this policy. In
        addition, we may also share General Information for the same reasons as
        we provide Personal Information and for business partners and others to
        conduct analyses and research and track marketing performance or as
        otherwise provided in the Tracking Technologies part herein.<br />

        Some of our pages utilize framing or white-labeling techniques to serve
        content from our partners while preserving the look and feel of our

        techniques. Please be aware that in these instances you are providing
        your Personal Information to these third parties and not to Orka.<br />

          <li>

        Your Rights and Choices<br />
        <br />

        The CCPA provides consumers, including owners/guarantors of small
        business loans (California residents), with specific rights regarding
        their personal information. Orka is providing these rights to California
        consumer residents who have provided their personal information as part
        of an Orka application or loan. This section describes the CCPA rights
        and explains how to exercise those rights. <br />

        You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal
        information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain

        applies.<br />
        <br />

        <em>Exceptions</em><br />
        <br />

        We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is

        methods:<br />
        <ul class="whale">
          <li>
            Call:<br />

            (844) 772-9289 or

          </li>
        </ul>
        Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State
        or other state agency that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make
        a Request related to your personal information.<br />
        <br />

        You may only make a Request for access or data portability twice within
        a 12-month period. The Request must:<br />
        <ul class="whale">
          <li>
            Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify
            you are the person about whom we collected personal information or
            an authorized representative.
          </li>
          <li>
            Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to
            properly understand, evaluate and respond to it.
          </li>
        </ul>
        We can’t respond to your request or provide you with personal
        information if we are unable to verify your identity or authority to
        make the request and confirm the personal information as it relates to
        you. Making a Request does not require you to create an account with us.
        We will only use personal information provided in a Request to verify
        your identity or authority to make the request.<br />
        <br />

        <em>Response Timing and Format</em><br />
        <br />

        We endeavor to respond to a Request in writing within 45 days of its
        receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of
        the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with
        us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not
        have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or
        electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will cover
        the 12-month period preceding the receipt of the Request. The response
        we provide will also explain the reasons we can’t comply with a request,
        if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to
        provide the information that is readily useable and should allow you to
        transmit the information from one entity to another entity without
        hindrance.<br />
        <br />

        We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your Request unless it
        is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that
        the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why and provide you with a
        cost estimate before completing your request.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>Non-Discrimination</strong><br />
        <br />

        We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights.
        Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not, because you have exercised
        rights under the CCPA:
        <br />
        <ul class="whale">
          <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
          <li>
            Charge you different prices for goods or services, including through
            granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
          </li>
          <li>
            Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or
            services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
          </li>
        </ul>
