        <strong>Orka Finance Inc. Terms and Conditions</strong> <br />
        <br />
        The Orka website (each as defined below) are operated by Orka Finance
        Inc., or any subsidiary of affiliate thereof (collectively, “Orka”,
        “we”, or “us”). Orka is in the business of providing customers with
        small business solar loans and related services (“Service”). Orka is not
        a broker, investment advisor or financial planner, and we do not provide
        financial, securities, legal or tax advice. Before making any decision
        or implementing any strategy you should consider obtaining additional
        information and advice from your accountant, attorney, and/or other
        advisors. “You” is defined as the owner of the company completing the
        application on behalf of the company seeking credit. Unless otherwise
        noted, any agreements, authorizations or consents made by you or
        permissions granted to you hereunder also apply and are binding on your
        company seeking credit directly from Orka, or from a bank that
        originates credit through Orka’s platform (“Orka Bank Partner”).
        <br />
        <br />

        <strong>Accepting the Terms</strong> <br />
        <br />
        By using the information, tools, features and functionality located at
        https://www.orkafinance.com or subdomains (the “Website”) or by
        submitting an application for credit to Orka, you represent and warrant
        that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by these terms and
        conditions (the “Agreement”) for any and all applications for credit to
        Orka or an Orka Bank Partner. You further agree that all information
        being provided by your company as the borrower and/or by you (either as
        a guarantor or as an authorized representative of your company) as part
        of the application process for the Loan is true and complete.
        <br />
        <br />
        You may not use the Service and you may not accept this Agreement if you
        are under 18 years of age. You represent that you have the capacity to
        bind the company or entity applying for credit, on behalf of such
        company or entity. You understand that (a) we may require you to sign a
        personal guarantee for the credit obtained by your company from Orka,
        and (b) for term loans, we may file a UCC-1 fixture filing on the solar
        equipment. Before you continue, you should print or save a copy of this
        Agreement for your records.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to this Agreement, you and your company may enter into other
        agreements, including a loan agreement or promissory note that will
        govern the terms of your company’s loan or line of credit and use of the
        Service. If there is a conflict between this Agreement and such other
        agreements that is applicable to specific aspects of the Service, the
        other agreement shall govern with respect to those specific aspects.
        <br />
        <br />

        Orka may make changes to this Agreement from time to time. If we do
        this, the date at the top of this page indicates when the latest
        revisions were made. Your continued use of the Service or the Website
        will constitute acceptance of such revisions.
        <br />
        <br />

        <strong>Credit and Background Check Authorization</strong> <br />
        <br />

        You understand and agree that Orka and our agents and assignees are
        authorized to contact third parties to conduct background checks and
        other investigative reports, including but not limited to your business
        revenue/sales data, and make credit report inquiries (including
        requesting personal credit bureau reports about you and any other
        owner(s) of the business who will be providing a personal guarantee, and
        business credit bureaus about your company, in either case, from credit
        reporting agencies and other sources) or for any other lawful purpose.
        Orka has such authority for the foregoing in connection with any
        extension of credit to the company on whose behalf you are applying,
        conducting loan file updates, ongoing loan reviews, renewal of
        financing, or referral of your business to third party lenders. Upon
        your written request, we will advise you if we obtained a credit report.
        You understand and agree that Orka is making no commitment or guarantee
        that any product, evaluation, or guidance provided by Orka will result
        in an approval of credit from Orka or any Orka Bank Partner.

        <br />
        <br />

        <strong>Privacy, Personal and Company Information</strong> <br />
        <br />

        For information about Orka’s data protection practices, please read our
        Privacy Policy, which can be accessed on the Website, as modified from
        time to time, which is hereby incorporated into this Agreement. The
        Privacy Policy explains how Orka collects and treats your personal and
        company information, and protects your privacy, when you access Orka and
        use the Service. The policy may be updated from time to time at our
        discretion. Changes will be effective upon posting to the Website.

        <br />
        <br />

        <strong>Identity Verification</strong> <br />
        <br />

        To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money
        laundering activities, federal law requires financial institutions to
        obtain, verify, and record identifying information that identifies each
        person and entity applying for credit. Therefore, when your company
        applies for credit, we ask for your name, address, and other information
        that allows us to identify you and your company. We may also ask for a
        driver’s license or other identifying documents. You allow us to obtain
        such information and share the information with third parties to help us
        verify you and your company’s identity.
        <br />
        <br />
        In connection with the provision of the Service, users may submit
        financial information from their business banking account(s) to Orka.
        Orka and Orka Bank Partners use this information for lending decisions
        and may require updates to monitor the performance of customers on an
        ongoing basis. With the Service, users may direct Orka to retrieve your
        company information maintained online or otherwise by third-party
        financial institutions or organizations authorized to house such
        information.
        <br />
        <br />

        All content on the Website or used by the Service, including but not
        limited to text, names, designs, pictures, information and software are

        <br />

        You are permitted to use content delivered to you through the Service or
        Website, only on the Service. You may not copy, reproduce, modify,

        You hereby consent to receive by electronic means, (or in writing
        through postal mail or email), this Agreement, communications,
        disclosures and notices, including any and all disclosures and/or
        notices required to be given by applicable law or regulation. You also
        consent to allow Orka, or an Orka Bank Partner, to respond to any

        of the format of the original inquiry. You must also agree to our ESign
        consent during the online application process.

        <br />
        <br />

        <strong>Telephone Communications</strong> <br />
        <br />

        You authorize Orka and those acting on its behalf to deliver or cause to
        be delivered advertisements or telemarketing messages, including calls,
        text messages, and SMS and MMS messages, using an automatic telephone
        dialing system (often referred to as an autodialer) or an artificial or
        prerecorded voice, to the telephone numbers you have provided in your
        application for credit to Orka (including your cellular phone numbers).
        You agree that this consent applies even if the numbers you have
        provided are currently on any state, federal, or corporate Do-Not-Call
        registry. You understand that you are not required to provide this
        consent as a condition of receiving any credit or services from Orka,
        and that you may apply for business credit by contacting us directly.
        You may opt out of receiving calls and marketing from Orka and its
        affiliates, marketing partners, agents and others as provided in the
        Privacy Policy or by contacting us directly.

        Agreement and Orka policies no longer apply.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition, if any such link is to another capital provider or lender,
        Orka acts solely as a referrer and does not guarantee or underwrite the

        capital provider or lender. You will be deemed a customer of that
        capital provider or lender with respect to any products or services
        provided by such capital provider or lender. Orka has no role in, nor
        any liability for any decision made or product or service provided by
        such other capital provider or lender.
