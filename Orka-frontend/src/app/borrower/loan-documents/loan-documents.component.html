      All set! Your Business bank account has been added. Now, letâ€™s proceed to
      your Loan Documents

      Your Loan Agreement and Personal Guaranty Form are ready for you to review
      and sign. Your Loan Agreement contains your estimated monthly payment,
      which will be finalized once your project reaches commercial operation and
      your loan is fully funded. A copy of the Personal Guaranty Form has been
      emailed to all Business Owners listed in the initial Credit Application.
      All Business Owners will need to sign this form in order to fund your
      loan. <br />
      <br />

      Next, if you choose to enable autopay by authorizing your Business bank
      account to pay your Solar Loan by ACH every month, you will be eligible to
      save 0.50% on your interest rate and lower your monthly payment.
